#### HTML - Anchor Tags & Quotations

The anchor element `<a>` is an HTML element which contains an "href" attribute that houses the URL address.

The URL address will then be encoded on an HTML page as a hyperlink, meaning it can be clicked to access the target destination as defined in the href attribute.

Within the href attribute, the link can also be assigned to a string of text.

The target attribute, meanwhile, specifies where to open the linked document. 
- In the same window/tab it was clicked on
- A new window/tab
- In the full body of the window
- etc.,

Content within the element indicates the links destination

#### QUOTATIONS AND CITATIONS

There are multiple HTML elements for handling quotations.

These include:
- `<blockquote>`
- `<q>`
- `<abbr>`
- `<address>`
- `<cite>`
- `<bdo>`

The blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source. These elements are typically indented by browsers automatically.

The short quotations element `<q>`, with browsers typically inserting quotation marks around each `<q>` element automatically.

The abbreviation element `<abbr>` handles abbreviations or acronyms, such as "HTML" itself. Defining these abbreviations provides additional information to browsers and search engines, etc.

The address `<address>` tag handles contact information for the author of a document/article.

The citation `<cite>` element defines the title of a creative work. Browsers typically render these elements in italics.

The bi-directional overdrive `<bdo>` element

    <!-- ***** Course objectives ***** -->
    <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
    <p> By the end of this semester, you should be able to: </p>

    <!-- Nested course objective list -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Work with ambiguous client requirements in order to create a full stack web application with 
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand HTTP well enough to 
        <ul>
          <li>Debug broken websites</li>
          <li>Optimize poorly performing websites</li>
          <li>Use REST API calls to client specifications</li>
          <li>Choose the appropriate HTTP method for appropriate scenarios</li>
          <li>Describe to a lay person the benefits of HTTPS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Create accessible web applications</li>
    </ol>


    <!-- ***** Course format ***** -->
    <h2>Course Format</h2>
    <p>This course is going to go beyond the traditional lecture format, and will at times include:   </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lab-based lectures </li>
      <li>Student lead learning</li>
      <li>Ambiguous real-world engineering problems</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- ***** Academic honesty ***** -->
    <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
    <p>
For individual assignments, I expect you to complete the work entirely by yourself. Passing someone
else's work as your own will not be tolerated. However, I encourage you to discuss course topics with
me or your peers! Often all it takes to understand a topic is to talk it through with someone else. If
you're unclear about this distinction, I'd be happy to talk it over with you.
    </p>

    <h2>Generative AI</h2>
    <p>
      Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, are extremely beneficial to learning and coding. In fact, I
      encourage you to use generative AI for the following use cases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>As a virtual tutor to clarify course concepts</li>
      <ul>

        <li>e.g., how do I import CSS into my web page?</li>
        <li>e.g., why is HTTPS an important protocol?</li>
      </ul>
      <li>As a code reviewer </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          i.e., pasting your code into a chat service to get feedback on your code
        </li>
      </ul> 
      <li>Explaining code snippets that you don’t understand</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          e.g., “why does every web page start with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>?”
        </li>
      </ul> 


    </ul>
 
    <p>
      On the other hand, generative AI output is often very incorrect, so I encourage you to cross reference its
      output. Also, just as you shouldn’t copy off of a fellow student, don’t copy off of ChatGPT. In short,
      avoid:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Directly copying and pasting entire programs from generative AI models</li>
      <li>Using code from generative AI models that you don’t understand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
In other words, treat generative AI as a classmate: someone you can discuss course topics with, but
don’t copy and paste their work or copy off of their work during an exam.

    </p>



    <!-- ***** Late Policy ***** -->
    <h2>Late Policy</h2>

    <ul >
      <li>
          If you feel that you cannot finish an assignment well before the due date, then please contact
          me, and we can discuss whether or not an extension is feasible. You must contact far ahead of
          the due date (i.e., don’t wait until 5 minutes before the assignment due date). Extensions will
          ultimately be under my discretion. Examples of excuses are:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Family emergencies                    </li>
        <li> Heath emergencies                     </li>
        <li> Extraordinary work loads              </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
         You can have 1 freebie assignment extension that you may use to add one extra week to any
          assignment without any excuse. Use this wisely!
      </li>
      <li>All unexcused assignment grades will be reduced by 30% every day past its due date.</li>
    </ul>
